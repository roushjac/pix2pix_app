# pix2pix_app - Deep Sketcher

A mobile implementation of the pix2pix deep learning algorithm. The model associated with this app is found in my repo forked from the original Tensorflow implementation [here](https://github.com/affinelayer/pix2pix-tensorflow).

[Interactive web demo](https://affinelayer.com/pixsrv/) - example of what this app will do.

As of May 2019, this project is being put on hold to work on other projects. Implementing the model on a mobile device will take more time than was anticipated at the undertaking of this project.

## TODO
1. Convert the output of the original pix2pix tensorflow implementation into .tflite format
  a) OR write new implementation in tensorflow 2.0/keras - would take more time but give me a much better understanding of the model
2. Deploy the model to Firebase
3. Use image drawn on mobile screen as input to model
4. Display output of model onto screen
